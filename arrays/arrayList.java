        //Advantages -
        //1. We dont need to mention size unlike arrays when creating arraylists.
        //2. Helpful when size is not known beforehand.
        //3. Arraylist has better interoperability with other collections.
        //4. ArrayList<Integer> ensures type safety at compile-time.

        //It implements list interface. As part of collections framework, it has many features not available with arrays.
